## Tests - Gradle & Jackson
**Before writting my first serious app i want to learn how Gradle works. I will need some functions for my Fishcards app (first own project) so i will test it right here and i'll prepare some classes.**

I'll need this functions (that i don't know yet):

- JSON operations (Reading, writing, parsing)
- JACKSON framework
- Downloading files from URL
- Creating local files and directories
